To run this project:

`npm start --prob 1`

Command line args will be added in the future to select the desired problem to run.

**Goals:**
All projects regardless of programming language should have a similar structure and approach.
My personal goal for the TypeScript problems is to resolve them using a concise coding style without sacrificing too much readability.
