Pre-requisites: Node 20+, TypeScript 5.3+

To run this project:

`npm start`

**Goals:**
All projects regardless of programming language should have a similar structure and approach.
My personal goal for the TypeScript problems is to resolve them using a concise coding style without sacrificing too much readability.
