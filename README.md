## Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! Here, you'll find my problem-solving solutions using three different programming languages: C#, TypeScript, and Go.

### Objectives:

I've set individual objectives for each language, aligning with my current proficiency and the language's strengths. I believe this diverse approach will showcase a wide array of problem-solving techniques and styles across all languages.

### Structure:

- **C#:** I've challenged myself to write solutions that aim for minimal heap allocations while maintaining readability. It's certainly a delicate balance!
  
- **TypeScript:** For TypeScript solutions, I've focused on succinctness and minimalism. I'm striving for concise code without compromising clarity.
  
- **Go:** My goal with Go solutions is to utilize idiomatic constructs and achieve decent performance. I'm keen on exploring the elegance of Go in this context.

### What to Expect:

Each language has its own folder with solutions to the Advent of Code challenges. I've included specific README files within each directory, providing further instructions.

Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback or suggestions!

Meryovi.-
