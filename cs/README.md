Pre-requisites: .NET 8+

To run this project:

`dotnet test -l "console;verbosity=normal"`

To run Benchmarks:

`dotnet run`

You can also go to Program.cs and tweak the runner to run the benchmark for a specific problem.

**Goals:**
All projects regardless of programming language should have a similar structure and approach.
My personal goal for the C# problems is to resolve them using a coding style that minimizes heap allocations, but keeping a balance with readability and conciseness.
